vdetect.sh 

I started working on this script to make it easier when working with a customer in identifying what CMS they were using. 
Over time I have went from just 3 types to tripling that, and I will in the end hopefully have almost all commonly used CMS systems detectable. 
I have also added Live Version update checking to this tool to make sure it stays upto date with out having to do any coding changes.  
The current Live checks are for: Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, phpBB, Magento, Zen Cart, Moodle 

In the newest version I have added Self Version Checking and replacement -- will be adding self restarting in future
